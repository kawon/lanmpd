lanmpd
======
...aims to provide a nice interface for music in an intranet or at a lan party.

The idea is to provide an easy interface to [mpd](http://mpd.wikia.com) for multiple users with different permissions. At a later point it should be possible for people who are no geeks to add their own music, maybe via smb share? Who knows...

Features
--------
Just a basic django app so far.
